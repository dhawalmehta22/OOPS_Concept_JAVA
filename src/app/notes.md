> 4 pillars of OOPS
*  Encapsulation
*  Polymorphism
*  abstraction
*  Inheritance

## Inheritance / Generalisation

> property of one object is aquired by another object
> is-a replationship
> 
> Some advantages
* code reusablity
* Extensiblity
* Overridding
* Data hidding (Privatising)
>no multiple inheritance supported --> Multiple parents having same object --> it is opposite of hierarchical inheritance

## **polymorphism**
> having same name with different dwfinations
> 2 types: -
* Compile time / Static  --> Over **_loading_** --> Compiler will evaluate that which MEthord will be executed with which funtion call.
* *  Over **_loading_**
* * * must have different argument list
* * * can have different return type
* Run time / Runtime --> Over **_ridding_** --> 
* *  Over **_ridding_**
* * * must have same argument list
* * * must have same return type

## **Abstraction**
> Achieving runtime polymorphism
> Achieved through abstract classes and interfaces 
### abstract
> Abstract keyword
* * we cannot create objects
* * we can have abstract/non abstract methods
* * can have static methods and constructors 
* * can have final methods.

### interface
