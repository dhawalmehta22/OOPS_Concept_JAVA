> 4 pillars of OOPS
*  Encapsulation
*  Polymorphism
*  abstraction
*  Inheritance

## Inheritance / Generalisation

> property of one object is aquired by another object
> is-a replationship
> 
> Some advantages
* code reusablity
* Extensiblity
* Overridding
* Data hidding (Privatising)
>no multiple inheritance supported --> Multiple parents having same object --> it is opposite of hierarchical inheritance

## polymorphism
> having same name with different dwfinations
> 2 types: -
* Compile time / Static  --> Over**_loading_** --> Compiler will evaluate that which MEthord will be executed with which funtion call
* Run time
